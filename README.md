# iamkhattar's private dotfiles

## Overview

Welcome to my private dotfiles repository! This repository contains personal configuration files (often referred to as dotfiles
because they typically start with a dot, like `.zshrc` or `.vimrc`) that I use to personalize and customize my development
environment. 

## Prerequisites

Install Public Dotfiles from [https://github.com/iamkhattar/dotfiles](https://github.com/iamkhattar/dotfiles)

## Installation

1. Clone the dotfiles into the local repository:

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/iamkhattar/local-dotfiles.git ~/.dotfiles/local
    ```
   
2. Stow the dotfiles:

    ```bash
    cd $HOME/.dotfiles && stow local
    ```
